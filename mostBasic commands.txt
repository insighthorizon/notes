    Piping and redirection
Every program we run on the command line automatically has three data streams connected to it.

    STDIN (0) - Standard input (data fed into the program)
    STDOUT (1) - Standard output (data printed by the program, defaults to the terminal)
    STDERR (2) - Standard error (for error messages, also defaults to the terminal)
>
    Save output to a file.
>>
    Append output to a file.
<
    Read input from a file.
2>
    Redirect error messages.
|
    Send the output from one program as input to another program.
